CoronaTracker is a notifier bot. <br>
The boy will notify via email and Discord bot, and can send updates direct to specific channel.

The info collection and the calculation happen in the script itself.
The goal was to get 'true info' between specific times, cause Ministry of Health supplied missing info.
